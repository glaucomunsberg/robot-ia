## Build process

### Chassis

the chassis is the main structure of the robot. I use the kit chassi 4WD and you can buy the chassis in the [Buying list](../components/buying.md) page. After assembling the chassis, you can install the motors and the wheels.

You can see the assembly process in the [Chassis](chassis.md) page.
