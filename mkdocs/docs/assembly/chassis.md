## Introduction

The chassis is the main structure of the robot. I use the kit chassi 4WD and you can buy the chassis in the [Buying list](../components/buying.md) page. After assembling the chassis, you can install the motors and the wheels.


## Tutorial

I use the video below to assemble the chassis.

## Result


When finished assembling the chassis, it will look like the image below a chassis with 4 wheels connected to the motors.
