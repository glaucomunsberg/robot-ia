## Ideia

The idea is composed by directives that the robot must follow to reach the goal. We create a `name` and a `description` to the idea is a text field that describes the idea.


## Exemplo

```json
{
  "idea": {
    "name": "go to forward",
    "description": "I want to start walking until I find a wall",
    "commands": []
  }
}
```
